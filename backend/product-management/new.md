Problem Statement: Build a Simple Product Management Backend API
Objective:
Create a basic backend API using Node.js and Express that allows users to manage a list of products. The products should be stored in an in-memory array (no database required), and the API should support basic CRUD operations.

Requirements:
You need to implement the following endpoints:

GET /products
# Returns a list of all products:
POST /products
Adds a new product to the array.
Expects a JSON body with the product details (e.g., name, price, description).
Assign a unique ID to each product (e.g., using Date.now()).
GET /products/:id
Returns a single product by its ID.
If the product does not exist, return a 404 error.
PUT /products/:id
Updates a product’s details based on its ID.
If the product does not exist, return a 404 error.
DELETE /products/:id
Deletes a product by its ID.
If the product does not exist, return a 404 error.
Constraints:
Use Node.js and Express.
Store product data in an array in memory.
Do not use any external database or file-based storage.
Properly handle error cases (e.g., product not found, invalid input).
Bonus (Optional):
Add input validation to ensure required fields such as name and price are present.
Add query parameters to filter products in the GET /products endpoint (e.g., by name or price range).
Example Product Object:

{
  "id": 1718032492356,
  "name": "Wireless Mouse",
  "price": 25.99,
  "description": "Ergonomic wireless mouse with USB receiver"
}
